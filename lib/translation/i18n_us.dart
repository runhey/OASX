Fill in "auto" to automatically detect the emulator. When multiple emulators are running or an emulator that does not support automatic detection is used, "auto" cannot be used and must be filled in manually.

[MuMu Player]: 127.0.0.1:7555 
[LDPlayer](all series): emulator-5554 or 127.0.0.1:5555
If it's not mentioned, it may not have been tested or is not recommended. You can try it yourself. 
If you use the multi-instance function of the emulator, their serials will not be the default. You can query them by executing adb devices in console.bat, or fill them in according to the official emulator tutorial''',

  '''Fill in "auto" to automatically detect the emulator. "auto" cannot be used when multiple emulators are running or when using an emulator that does not support automatic detection; it must be filled in manually.

Handle Title: 
[MuMu Player 12]: "MuMu Player 12" 
[MuMu Player]: "MuMu Player" 
[LDPlayer](all series): "LDPlayer"

Handle Number: 
Some emulators have the same handle title when multiple instances are opened (referring to MuMu). In this case, you need to manually obtain the emulator's handle number and set it manually.

Using window_background for screenshots is about 10ms, compared to DroidCast_raw which is about 100ms (only on the author's computer). However, window_background has a fatal flaw: the emulator cannot be minimized. 
nemu_ipc is limited to MuMu Player 12 and requires a version greater than 3.8.13, and the emulator's execution path needs to be set''',
